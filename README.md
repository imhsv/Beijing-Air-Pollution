"Forecasting a Breath of Fresh Air: Predicting PM2.5 Air Pollution in Beijing with Machine Learning"

Our Mission:
We're using cutting-edge Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict Beijing's air quality, specifically targeting PM2.5 pollution levels, one hour into the future.

Why It Matters:
Clean air is essential for your health and well-being. Our accurate predictions empower you to make informed decisions about outdoor activities, commuting, and more.

How We Do It:
We gather vast historical and real-time data, then employ Deep Learning models to analyze weather, traffic, and more, ensuring you have up-to-the-minute air quality information.

Join the Movement:
Be part of the solution. Use our predictions to protect yourself and contribute to a cleaner Beijing.

Conclusion:
Breathe easy, Beijing. We're revolutionizing air quality prediction for a healthier, brighter future.

> One of the leading Global pollution controller organizations.
> The company is working its way for the betterment of society by using advanced technologies to purify the air by removing harmful particles from the atmosphere.
# Current Scenario
>As we know in recent years the pollution emitted per day has increased drastically, countries all around the world are taking up action in order to tackle the rapid increase in pollution to avoid global warming.
>Beijing’s pollution authority has collected data for the past 5 years and the data has been passed on to clients by the government of China.
The company calculates pollution using traditional or manual methods, so it needs a model to do the long process.

# Currently, Beijing is suffering from:
> China is notorious for being a major polluter. Its economic growth in the past three decades has been the fastest among major nations, which is the main factor in > > why China has extensive air pollution.
> China’s Environmental Sustainability Index is ranked near the bottom among countries worldwide.
> Air Pollution in Beijing is mainly dominated by coal combustion and vehicles running on the roads.
> With this amplified wealth, individuals are more capable of affording motor vehicles. The number of motor vehicles on Beijing’s roads has doubled to 3.3 million with nearly 1200 added each day.


# MY Role
>  The dataset contains the past few years of air quality (2013-2017).
> The data is from the 12 stations of Beijing that have been thoroughly observed.
> The task is to build a regression model using the dataset.
> Only the need to build the best possible model.

# Data 
[Data](https://github.com/imhsv/Beijing-Air-Pollution/blob/main/data)

Train Set: 
> The train set contains 403776 rows and 17 columns.
> The train set contains data from 2013-16.
> The column PM2.5 is the target variable.

Test Set:
> The test set contains 16728 rows and 16 columns.
> The test set contains data for 2017.
> The test set doesn’t contain the PM2.5 column.
> PM2.5 needs to be predicted for the test set
