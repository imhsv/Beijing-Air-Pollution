# Beijing-Air-Quality
# Introduction
This project has applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to analyse and predict the Air Quality in Beijing. Our task is to predict one hour into the future the concentration level of air pollutant PM2.5.
# Company 
Airifi-
> One of the leading Global pollution controller organizations.
> The company is working its way for the betterment of the society by using advanced technologies to purify the air by removing harmful particles from the atmosphere.
# Current Scenario
>As we know in recent years the pollution emitted per day has increased drastically, countries all around the world are taking up actions in order to tackle the rapid increase in pollution to avoid global warming.
>Beijing’s pollution authority has collected data for the past 5 years and the data has been passed on to client by the government of China.
The company calculates pollution using traditional or manual methods, so it needs a model to do the long process.

# Currently, Beijing is suffering from:
> China is notorious for being a major polluter. Its economic growth in the past three decades has been the fastest among major nations, which is the main factor in > > why China has extensive air pollution.
> China’s Environmental Sustainability Index is ranked near the bottom among countries worldwide.
> Air Pollution in Beijing is mainly dominated by coal combustion and vehicles running on the roads.
> With this amplified wealth, individuals are more capable of affording motor vehicles. The number of motor vehicles on Beijing’s roads has doubled to 3.3 million with nearly 1200 added each day.


# MY Role
> You are given a dataset of the past few years of the air quality (2013-2017).
> The data is from the 12 stations of Beijing that have been thoroughly observed.
> Your task is to build a regression model using the dataset.
> Because there was no machine learning model for this problem in the company, you don’t have a quantifiable win condition. You need to build the best possible model.

# Data 
[Data](https://github.com/imhsv/Beijing-Air-Pollution/blob/main/data)

Train Set: 
> The train set contains 403776 rows and 17 columns.
> The train set contains data from 2013-16.
> The column PM2.5 is the target variable.

Test Set:
> The test set contains 16728 rows and 16 columns.
> The test set contains data for 2017.
> The test set doesn’t contain the PM2.5 column.
> PM2.5 needs to be predicted for the test set

# Analysis and Model Evaluation
 Its all work done in notebooks.
